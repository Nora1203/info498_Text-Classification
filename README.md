# Project 2: Text Classification

**Objectives:** To train text classification models and analyze their results.

## Train a logistic regression model for binary classification

## Implement a KNN model for multi-class classification using BERT document embeddings

## Comparing classification models

14. (10 pt) For each of the two models you trained (logistic regression and KNN), discuss its pros and cons. Why might someone choose one model architecture over another?
